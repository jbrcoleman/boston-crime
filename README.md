# boston-crime
Boston is the most populous city in New England. It’s population is close to three-quarters of a
million and continues to increase every year. Understanding Crime in large cities is an important
issue not only to improve safety but to increase public awareness. If these types of studies are
published, the citizens would do their part in staying safe and help reduce the burden on law
enforcement.
This project explores Boston’s Crime statistics from 2015 to 2018 and provides some insights
into various types of Crimes that were reported. It also provides details of serious crimes (
compared to minor offences) and when these are most likely to occur.
